          <p class="about-body-main">
            Hi, I’m Sienna Nazarian, a concerned community member born and
            raised in Los Angeles, California. After learning and exploring the
            effects of gentrification, I became consumed with the reality that
            people can feel culturally, physically, and socially isolated within
            their own communities. I was then inspired to brainstorm ways to
            create social equity through urban development. I found that there
            was no easy way for community members to voice their opinions,
            except for the limited speaking time at city council meetings –
            which are conveniently scheduled during most working hours.
          </p>
          <p>
            Knowing that technology can revolutionize the way people interact
            with their neighbors, I was inspired to develop a mobile app that
            allows community members to voice their opinions by providing
            feedback on proposed municipal developments and policies. CityPoll’s
            vision is to elevate every individual’s voice and empower everyone
            to feel like an active community member.
          </p>
          <p>
            To accomplish this goal, I thought it was important to connect the
            voices of 3 primary stakeholders:
          </p>
          <h2 class="about-sub">For Residents</h2>
          <p class="about-body-main">
            1. Have a stake in what happens in your community by voting and
            sharing your opinions with fellow community members and those
            shaping it
          </p>
          <p class="about-body-main">
            2. Get more transparency about the developments and policies in your
            area and build relationships with developers, city planners, and
            local officials so they know what your needs are
          </p>
          <h2 class="about-sub">For Developers</h2>
          <p class="about-body-main">
            1. Post your development plans and receive the feedback necessary to
            build projects in collaboration with those directly impacted
          </p>
          <p class="about-body-main">
            2. A faster process in receiving a permit from the City Council, as
            residents needs will be addressed during the planning process for
            more transparency
          </p>
          <h2 class="about-sub">For Local Governments</h2>
          <p class="about-body-main">
            1. Have a clearer picture of the community’s needs so you can make
            decisions based on the true voice of the people being affected by
            the issues being raised
          </p>
          <p class="about-body-main">
            2. A faster process in granting permits to developers, as
            developers’ plans will have already addressed constituents’ needs
          </p>
